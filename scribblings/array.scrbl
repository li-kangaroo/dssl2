@title{The @tt{testing} library}

This library is actually just a test.

You can use it to create as many different hash functions as you need.

These definitions are not part of the base DSSL2 language, and must be imported
explicitly using: @racket[import sbox_hash]

@section{Class @tt{SboxHash64}}

@tt{SboxHash64} objects are wrappers around a substitution-box-based hash
function. Constructing a new object creates a new hash function.

The @tt{SboxHash64} constructor takes no arguments.

@defmethform[SboxHash64 hash]{@proto[AnyC nat?]}

This method is the hash function proper. It accepts any value and hashes it to
a (possibly very large!) natural number.

@section{Convenience}

@defprocform[make_sbox_hash]{(): @racket[FunC][@racket[AnyC], @racket[nat?]]}

Creates a new standalone substitution-box-based hash function and returns it.
